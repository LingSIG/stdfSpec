            <p>This document compiles various concrete use cases implementing the suggested <gi>standOff</gi> element in order to a) identify possible annotation configurations that may be used as
               recommended practices for the corresponding phenomena and b) refine the possible constraints that may bear upon it and its sub-elements. It is based on the experience gained in various
               projects since the initial workshop that took place in <date>January 2014</date> and which launched the definition of this element, as well as on some ongoing activities that are being
               pursued in several national projects in France and Germany (among others), in international institutions (EPO) and in the content of several ISO projects (some of which have already
               been published as standards).</p>
            <p>The major conclusions that can be drawn from these use cases are the following:</p>
            <list>
               <item>There are only two new elements to add to the TEI space: <list>
                     <item><gi>standOff</gi>: the general container, designed as a mini-<q><gi>TEI</gi></q> document dedicated to gather all annotation related information for a given annotation
                        layer</item>
                     <item><gi>listAnnotation</gi>: a list like element within <gi>standOff</gi> to allow various types of groupings for stand-off annotations</item>
                  </list></item>
               <item>The content model of <gi>annotationBlock</gi> must be revised to integrate the multiple usage scenarios that have been identified. Basically we need an alternative
                     (<gi>choice</gi>) betwen 2 or 3 possible content models.</item>

            <head>Overview of the <gi>standOff</gi> proposal</head>
            <note>This section should be conceived as text that would go in the guidelines</note>
            <p>This proposal implements embedded stand-off annotations, i.e. annotations to an existing document that have the following properties:</p>
            <list>
               <item>Annotations do not alter any part of the document itself, header nor content</item>
               <item>There may be as many complementary and competing annotations attached to a given document as wanted</item>
               <item>Annotations occur at a precisely determined place in the TEI documeent organisation, namely as an addtional resource, child of <gi>TEI</gi> or <gi>teiCorpus</gi>
                  <note>We need a scenario for such a usage</note></item>
               <item>Annotations are conveyed with their specific meta-data, to convey informaiton about origin (software, annotators), specific re-use rights, encoding schemes etc.</item>
            </list>
            <div>
               <head>The <gi>standOff</gi> element</head>
               <p>The <gi>standOff</gi> element is the container of any group of coherent annotations attached to a TEI document. Its main characteristics are:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>It is attached to the top level of a TEI document by being a member of <code>model.resourceLike</code></item>
                  <item>Its content model resembles that of a TEI document by comprising a header (<gi>teiHeader</gi>), additional resources (<code>model.resourceLike</code>) and a content (one or
                     several <gi>listAnnotation</gi> elements)</item>
               </list>
               <p>The actual nature of the <gi>standOff</gi> can be further specified by means of two attributes:</p>
               <list>
                  <item><att>type</att>: to indicate the general type of annotations which is being represented</item>
                  <item><att>notation</att>: to elicit the specific notation used for the corresponding type of annotation in reference to an external standard or a documented practice.</item>
               </list>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>The <gi>listAnnotation</gi> element</head>
               <p>The <gi>listAnnotation</gi> element is a general container allowing one to structure annotations in various subsections. In this respect, its role is analogous to the one played by
                     <gi>div</gi> in a general TEI document. Still, <gi>div</gi> could not be taken up here in order to be able to keep to a very restrained content model.</p>
               <p>As an iterative and recursive element, <gi>listAnnotation</gi> can be typed to indicate the organisational logic of the annotations.</p>
               <p>The <gi>listAnnotation</gi> element is also structured like other listXXX elements so that it may start with <code>model.headLike</code> members (e.g. <gi>head</gi>).</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>Updating the <gi>annotationBlock</gi> element</head>
               <p>The <gi>annotationBlock</gi> was initially conceived as a construct with a dual role for the inline and stand-off annotation of textual content. For the sake of having it quickly
                  inserted in the TEI guidelines, only a limited range of usages has been documented so far.</p>
               <p>In the stand-off annotation proposal, <gi>annotationBlock</gi> takes a major role as the elementary container for annotations.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>Taking up existing annotations mechanisms from the TEI vocabulary</head>
               <p>The TEI guidelines has a wide variety of elments to implement stand-off annotations. The purpose of this document is to provide more precise guidance as to how to combine them and
                  identify their complementarities. As this stage we can characterised these elements as follows:</p>
               <list>
                  <item><gi>span</gi> is a genral purpose element to point to a location or a sequence in a document and ideal to cover the general notion of <mentioned>markable</mentioned> in the
                     linguistic annotation literature.</item>
                  <item><gi>zone</gi>, which can be seen as playing a similar role to <gi>span</gi> in the case of images</item>
                  <item><gi>interp</gi>, which currently has a narrow scope in the TEI guidelines but offers the possibilities to connect annotated passages (<att>inst</att>) with annotation content
                        (<att>ana</att>)</item>
               </list>

               <p>The <ref target="#WADM">Open Annotation</ref> data model articulates around three complementary components:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Target: that identifies one or several <mentioned>resources</mentioned> about which something is said </item>
                  <item>Body: that contains what is said about the resource</item>
                  <item>Annotation: that links one or several targets with 0-n bodies</item>
               </list>
               <p>This model, which decouples resources and what is said about them by means of the <mentioned>annotation</mentioned> component, is highly flexible and powerful. It could be reflected
                  in the <gi>standOff</gi> construct as follows:</p>
               <p>It is suggested that the Open Annotation model could be implemented as follows:</p>
               <list>
                  <item><p>The <mentioned>Target</mentioned> component could be implement with either <gi>span</gi> for textual targets or <gi>zone</gi> when pointing to an image.</p>

                  <item>
                     <p>The <mentioned>Body</mentioned> component can be implemented by means of a wide variety of elements depending on the various use cases that we describe here.</p>

                  <item><p>The <mentioned>Annotation</mentioned> component is implemented by means of the <gi>interp</gi> element complemented with the three following atributes:</p>

                        <item><att>ana</att>: points to the actual content of the annotation, depending on the annotation scheme. In simple cases, these could be <gi>note</gi> (see below) or
                              <gi>fs</gi> elements.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Additional elements could probably be used here, but we should provide univocal guidance for such a use case, in order to avoid content model ambiguities and in general too

                  <head>Introduction</head>
                  <p>Named entity recognition is a typical use case for stand-off annotation. It is usually based upon an automatic analysis process of a digital text which produces various hypotheses
                     as to which entities (persons, events, organisations, dates, etc.) are actually mentionned. Given the variety of possible hypotheses, and the quantity of information that a NER
                     module may produce, it does not make sense in putting the resulting annotation inline. Besides, there is a need to record some specific metadata related to the NER process such as
                     the tool that has been used, the parameters given to the tool, etc.</p>
                  <p>The idea here is to contribute to the definition of a standardised output interface for NER components or online services so that such annotations can actually be re-used,
                     compared, visualised in a systematic way.</p>

            <p>In conformance to <ref target="#ISO24611">ISO 24611 (MAF)</ref>, word forms are represented by <gi>span</gi> elements, pointing to the corresponding token(s) in the source text (see the
               note below soncerning the use of the proper attributes). The actual analysis of the word form is provided by means of a feature-structure referred to from the <gi>span</gi> element by
               means of an <att>ana</att> attribute. The additional <att>corresp</att> attribute allows one to point to the lexical entries equivalent to the word form, when one links the
               morpho-synytactic annotation to a reference lexicon.</p>

            <note>This representation is not conformant to the Open Annotation model. In some way, the <gi>span</gi> element combines both roles of <mentioned>Target</mentioned> and
                  <mentioned>Annotation</mentioned> from WADM. The actual <mentioned>Body</mentioned> is made of both the feature structure and the lexical entry that are being pointing to.</note>
            <note>To be checked: should we use <att>from</att> and <att>to</att> instead of <att>target</att> here.</note>

               external entities (e.g. in the case of deixis).</p>
            <p>The work carried out within the project <ref target="#ISO24617-9">ISO 24617-9 (RAF)</ref> distinguishes to this purpose two types of annotation entities between which various types of

               <item><mentioned>referring expressions</mentioned>: correspond to the actual markables in the text. They may point to text spans, sequences of words (<gi>w</gi>) or higher level objects

            <p>In keeping with the ISO 24617-9 model, we organize the annotations in four sub groups marked up by typed <gi>listAnnotation</gi> elements:</p>

            <note>Sub-elements can be further structured in <gi>annotationBlock</gi> elements when they correspond to the same textual segment (e.g. sentence, utterance, etc.). This is meaningful for
               referring expressions, whereas the other annotation objects are more likely to correspond to inter-sentential mechanisms.</note>
            <p>For the sentence introduced before,we can markup two referring expressions (<q>une poire</q>, <q>la</q>), further qualified by means of a feature structure:</p>
